Super simple plugin to remove the Tools menu from WordPress Admin


== Description ==

This plugin does exactly what the title says, when activated will remove the Tools menu from your WordPress Admin navigation menu. If you need import, export, or the press-this bookmarklet again, simply deactivate the plugin, do your thing, then re-enable the Remove Tools Menu plugin to remove it again and keep it out of your way.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `remove-tools-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the Remove Tools Menu plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you create this as a plugin? =

Why not? In all the WP sites I've ever had I think I've only used the Import/Export thing like four times ever. For everyday normal use I got tired of it getting in my way. I created this plugin to share as others may want to hide it until needed.


== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =
* Now checks if remove_menu_page function exists and uses that if it does and will default to older method if not.
