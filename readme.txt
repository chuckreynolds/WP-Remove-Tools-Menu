Super simple plugin to remove the Tools menu from WordPress Admin

== Description ==
This plugin does exactly what the title says, when activated will remove the Tools menu from your WordPress Admin navigation menu. If you need import, export, or get the press-this bookmarklet again, or if any of your plugins add submenus into it, simply deactivate the plugin, do your thing, then re-enable the Remove Tools Menu plugin to remove it again and keep it out of your way. NOTE: there are certain plugins that add things to the Tools menu... those obviously won't show up either but the plugin still does what it was built to do. Have fun.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `remove-tools-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the Remove Tools Menu plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why did you create this as a plugin? =
Why not? In all the WP sites I've ever had I think I've only used the Import/Export thing like four times ever. For everyday normal use I got tired of it getting in my way. I created this plugin to share as others may want to hide it until needed.
